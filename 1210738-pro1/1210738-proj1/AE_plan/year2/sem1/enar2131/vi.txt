name The 'vi' is derived from the shortest unambiguous abbreviation
for the ex-command 'visual,' which switches the ex-line editor to  
its full-screen mode.

The original code for vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976, as the
visual mode for a line editor called ex that Joy had written with
Chuck Haley. Bill Joy's ex 1.1 was released as part of the first
Berkeley Software Distribution () Unix release in March 1978. It 
was not until version 2.0 of ex, released as part of Second in
May 1979, that the editor was installed under the name 'vi' (which 
took users straight into ex's visual mode), and the name by which
it is known today. Some current implementations of vi can trace
their source code ancestry to Bill Joy; others are completely new,
largely compatible reimplementation.
